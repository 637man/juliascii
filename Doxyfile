# Doxyfile 1.8.14

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all text
# before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the iconv
# built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = ISO-8859-2

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Juliascii Fractal"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = 1.4

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Julia fractal explorer for a semestral assignment."

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           = julia.png

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = ./doc

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator that is
# used to form the text in various listings. Each string in this list, if found
# as the leading text of the brief description, will be stripped from the text
# and the result, after processing the whole list, is used as the annotated
# text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. If left blank, the
# following values are used ($name is automatically replaced with the name of
# the entity):The $name class, The $name widget, The $name file, is, provides,
# specifies, contains, represents, a, an and the.

# If the ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC and REPEAT_BRIEF tags are both set to YES then
# doxygen will generate a detailed section even if there is only a brief
# description.
# The default value is: NO.

ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC    = YES

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. For
# instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list of all
# members will be omitted, etc.
# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES, all private members of a class will

# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be
# included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

# This flag is only useful for Objective-C code. If set to YES, local methods,
# which are defined in the implementation section but not in the interface are
# included in the documentation. If set to NO, only methods in the interface are
# included.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_LOCAL_METHODS  = YES

# If this flag is set to YES, the members of anonymous namespaces will be
# extracted and appear in the documentation as a namespace called
# 'anonymous_namespace{file}', where file will be replaced with the base name of
# the file that contains the anonymous namespace. By default anonymous namespace
# are hidden.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ANON_NSPACES   = YES

# If the HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all
# undocumented members inside documented classes or files. If set to NO these
# members will be included in the various overviews, but no documentation
# section is generated. This option has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.
# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS     = YES

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then doxygen will only generate file
# names in lower-case letters. If set to YES, upper-case letters are also
# allowed. This is useful if you have classes or files whose names only differ
# in case and if your file system supports case sensitive file names. Windows
# and Mac users are advised to set this option to NO.
# The default value is: system dependent.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag can be used to specify the character encoding of the source files
# that doxygen parses. Internally doxygen uses the UTF-8 encoding. Doxygen uses
# libiconv (or the iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See the libiconv
# documentation (see: https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/) for the list of
# possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

INPUT_ENCODING         = ISO-8859-2

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp and
# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories.
#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# read by doxygen.
#
# If left blank the following patterns are tested:*.c, *.cc, *.cxx, *.cpp,
# *.c++, *.java, *.ii, *.ixx, *.ipp, *.i++, *.inl, *.idl, *.ddl, *.odl, *.h,
# *.hh, *.hxx, *.hpp, *.h++, *.cs, *.d, *.php, *.php4, *.php5, *.phtml, *.inc,

# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE tag controls the color of the HTML output. Doxygen
# will adjust the colors in the style sheet and background images according to
# this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a colorwheel, see
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information. For instance the value
# 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is blue, 300
# purple, and 360 is red again.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 359, default value: 220.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE    = 30

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT tag controls the purity (or saturation) of the colors
# in the HTML output. For a value of 0 the output will use grayscales only. A
# value of 255 will produce the most vivid colors.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 255, default value: 100.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT    = 64

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA tag controls the gamma correction applied to the
# luminance component of the colors in the HTML output. Values below 100
# gradually make the output lighter, whereas values above 100 make the output
# darker. The value divided by 100 is the actual gamma applied, so 80 represents
# a gamma of 0.8, The value 220 represents a gamma of 2.2, and 100 does not
# change the gamma.
# Minimum value: 40, maximum value: 240, default value: 80.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA  = 128

# This tag determines the name of the docset feed. A documentation feed provides

# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_DOCSET is set to YES.

DOCSET_FEEDNAME        = "Doxygen generated docs"

# This tag specifies a string that should uniquely identify the documentation
# set bundle. This should be a reverse domain-name style string, e.g.

# The default value is: org.doxygen.Project.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_DOCSET is set to YES.

DOCSET_BUNDLE_ID       = org.doxygen.Project

# The DOCSET_PUBLISHER_ID tag specifies a string that should uniquely identify

# The QHP_NAMESPACE tag specifies the namespace to use when generating Qt Help
# Project output. For more information please see Qt Help Project / Namespace
# (see: http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qthelpproject.html#namespace).

QHP_NAMESPACE          = org.doxygen.Project

# A unique identifier for the Eclipse help plugin. When installing the plugin
# the directory name containing the HTML and XML files should also have this

# The default value is: org.doxygen.Project.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_ECLIPSEHELP is set to YES.

ECLIPSE_DOC_ID         = org.doxygen.Project

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine-tune the look of the index. As an example, the default style
# sheet generated by doxygen has an example that shows how to put an image at
# the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME. Since the tree basically has
# the same information as the tab index, you could consider setting
# DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

# readers/editors.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_RTF           = YES

# The RTF_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the RTF docs will be put. If a

# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_RTF is set to YES.

COMPACT_RTF            = NO

# If the RTF_HYPERLINKS tag is set to YES, the RTF that is generated will
# contain hyperlink fields. The RTF file will contain links (just like the HTML
# output) instead of page references. This makes the output suitable for online
# browsing using Word or some other Word compatible readers that support those
# fields.
#
# Note: WordPad (write) and others do not support links.

# optional.
# The default value is: .3.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_MAN is set to YES.

MAN_EXTENSION          = .3

# If the MAN_LINKS tag is set to YES and doxygen generates man output, then it
# will generate one additional man file for each entity documented in the real
# man page(s). These additional files only source the real man page, but without
# them the man command would be unable to find the correct page.
# The default value is: NO.
